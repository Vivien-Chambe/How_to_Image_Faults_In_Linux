# How to Recreate Linux Image

## Prerequisites
- The image was based on tha vailable Debian 12 nfs image deployed using kadeploy.

# Packages Installed
Packages are installed as root.
As I'm don't want to forget any packages I installed, I listed them in packages file.
You can install them using the following command:
```bash
apt-get update
dpkg --set-selections < packages
apt-get -u dselect-upgrade
```

You also need to install the following packages using opam:
camlp4              4.05+1      Camlp4 is a system for writing extensible parsers for programming languages
ocaml               4.05.0      The OCaml compiler (virtual package)
ocaml-base-compiler 4.05.0      Official 4.05.0 release
ocaml-config        1           OCaml Switch Configuration
ocamlbuild          0.14.3      OCamlbuild is a build system with builtin rules to easily build most OCaml projects
ocamlfind           1.9.6

You also need dune:
```bash
opam install dune
```

With that you should be able to install herodotos following the instructions in GitHub repository of herodotos.
https://github.com/coccinelle/herodotos

## Directories
There is also a directory in /var that points to linuxes in /srv/storage/linuxes@storage1.grenoble.grid5000.fr
Also need a directory /fast_scratch that is mounted using : 
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /fast_scratch
Make sure to modify permission accordingly

When everything is done you can return to frontend and use tgz-g5k tool to make the image using:
```bash
tgz-g5k -m <host_name> -f <image_name>.tar.gz
```
and finally create the environment description file accordingly to the grid5000 tutorial at https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Environment_creation.
